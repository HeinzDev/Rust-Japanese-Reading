# Rust Japanese Reading

Project created to assist in the rapid reading of words in Hiragana and Katakana from Japanese language. It uses the Rust programming language to implement an interactive learning program.

## How It Works

The program loads Japanese words (in Hiragana and Katakana) and their Romaji translations from a file named `words.txt`. Words are then randomly presented, and the user is challenged to provide the correct Romaji translation.

## Running

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a file named `words.txt` in the same directory as the code.
3. In the `words.txt` file, add pairs of Japanese words and their Romaji translations, separated by a comma:

```
カフェ,kafe
レストラン,resutoran
さくらんぼ,sakuranbo
```

4. Run the program using `cargo run` in the terminal. You can also build with `cargo build`.
